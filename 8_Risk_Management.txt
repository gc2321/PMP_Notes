8.Risk Management
--------------------------------

- most of the risk are identified in Identify Risk and Monitor Risk
- risk owner: response to risk trigger and implement risk responses
- must discuss risk in all team meetings
- Cardinal scales: ranking to identify probability and impact using a numerical value
- Ordinal scales: rank risks from very high to very unlikely
- Pure risk: risk that have only negative outcome

**** Plan Risk Management
- Risk Strategy
- Funding and timing
- Risk category: (1) External (2) Internal (3) Technical (4) Commercial (5) Unforeseeable
- PESTLE: Political, Economical, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental
- TECOP: Technical, Environmental, Commercial, Operational, Political
- VUCA: Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity
- Stakeholder risk appetite
- Utility function: person's willingness to tolerate risk
- Sources of risk: (Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resources, Customer satisfaction)

**** Identify Risk
- Brainstorming, checklist analysis, interview
- Root cause analysis, Assumption analysis, Constrain analysis
- Delphi method: multiple rounds of questionnaires sent to a panel of experts,
 the anonymous responses are aggregated and shared with the group
- Output: Risk Register

**** Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
- Data quality assessment, risk categorization
- Probability and Impact Matrix: a table of risk, their probability and impact
- Output: assumption log, issue log, risk register update, watch list (low priority list)

**** Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
- simulations, sensitivity analysis ("Tornado"), decision tree analysis
- Expected Monetary Value Analysis (EMVA)
- Output: risk register update

**** Plan Risk Responses
- Risk response strategies (avoid, mitigate, transfer, exploit, share, escalate, accept)
- involve all risk owners, Stakeholders
- Output: PMP update, risk register update, 

**** Implement Risk Responses

**** Monitor Risks
- workaround (only for risk not previously identified), 
- risk reassessments (for known risk), reserve analysis
- performance analysis, meetings
- Output: work performance information, risk register update, change requests
