--------------------------------

- product validation: occurs in project closing
- scope validation: occurs in beginning, allow customer's acceptance of deliverables
- scope validation: does not involve schedule

**** Plan scope Management
- covers both product and project scope

**** Collect Requirements
- Project Charter
- Assumption log
- Stakeholder registry
- voting, brain storming, affinity diagrams

- Mind mapping: show relationship among requirements and the difference between requirements
- Context diagram: highlighting the products and its interface with people, processes or systems
- Nominal group technique: generate many ideas and rank them by voting
- Requirements traceability matrix (RTM) - help to link requirements to objective

**** Define scope
- product analysis

**** Create WBS
- include only deliverables
- WBS do not show dependencies
- WBS: between 8 - 80 hours of work
- build WBS dictionary
- Scope baseline:
(1) Project scope statement
(2) WBS
(3) Control account: control point where schedule, budget, cost are integrated and 
compared to Earned Value Performance. Contains 2 or more work packages
(4) Planning package: Below Control account and above work packages. 
With work content but no schedule activities.

- anything missing in WBS should be evaluated in Perform Integrated Change Control process
