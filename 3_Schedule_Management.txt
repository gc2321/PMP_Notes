3.Schedule Management
--------------------------------

- Leveling: rearrange resources so that constant number of resources are available at a given time
- soft logic: allows PM to make decisions based on conditions outside of the project
- Parkinson's Law: work will expand to fulfill the time allotted to it.
- Flattened project schedule through resource leveling will likley increase project schedule duration

**** Plan Schedule Management

**** Define Activities
- Rolling waving planning
- Milestones

**** Sequence Activities
- Draw network diagrams
- Precedence Diagram Method
- determine dependencies (Mandatory, Discretionary, External, Internal)
- leads and lags

**** Estimate Activity Duration
- one-point estimate, analogous estimate
- parametric estimate (regression, learning curve, using parameters)
- three-point estimate (POM or PERT, triangular distribution (P+M+O)/3 or beta distribution (P+4M+O)/6)
- bottom-up estimate (longer but better)
- data analysis: alternative analysis, reserve analysis
- decision making

**** Develop Schedule
- Critical path / near critical path
- Float: 
(1) Total float (impact on the project) 
(2) Free float (impact on the successor)
(3) Project float or positive total float (impact on the something beyond the project)

- crashing: adding resources to compress the schedule while maintaining the scope, increase cost and risk
- fast track: do activities in parallel, change FS, SS, FF, add risk
- calculate reserve

**** Control Schedule
- performance reviews
- trend analysis
- variance analysis
