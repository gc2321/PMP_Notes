4.Cost Management
--------------------------------

- analogous estimate - uses top-down estimate
- parametric estimate - based on historical records
- Rough order magnitude (ROM) - made during project initiation
- Value Engineering: an approach to find less costly ways to complete the same work
- Present value (PV) = FV / (1+i) n
- opportunity cost = cost of project not chosen

**** Plan Cost Management
- identify WBS level at which EV will be calculated
- control how cost variance will be managed

**** Estimate Cost
- variable cost: costs that changes with amount of work
- fixed cost: costs that are constant
- direct cost: directly related to work
- indirect cost: cost that may benefit more than one project
- alternative analysis and reserve analysis
- identified risks are both input and output of estimate cost

**** Determine Budget
- establish baseline for measuring project Performance
- contingency reserve is added to the cost baseline

**** Control Costs

Budget at completion (BAC): 
Planned value (PV): estimated cost
Earned value (EV): percent complete * budget at completion
Actual cost (AC): amount spent so far

Cost variance (CV): EV - AC, +: under budget, -: over budget
Schedule variance (SV): EV - PV, +: ahead of Schedule, -: behind Schedule

Cost Performance Index (CPI): 
EV / AC, progression rate, > 1: under budget, < 1: over budget
x cent per dollar invested

Schedule Performance Index (SPI): 
EV / PV, > 1: ahead of schedule, < 1: behind schedule

Estimate at completion (EAC): BAC / CPI
